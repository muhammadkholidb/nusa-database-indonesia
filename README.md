## The Generated SQL Content

The generated SQL files contain `INSERT` statements for their respective tables. This data can be imported directly from these files.
 
The following DDL (Data Definition Language) script defines the required table structure:

```sql
CREATE TABLE provinces (
	id int4 NOT NULL GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY,
	name varchar NOT NULL,
	CONSTRAINT pk_pronvinces PRIMARY KEY (id)
);

CREATE TABLE cities (
	id int4 NOT NULL GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY,
	province_id int4 NOT NULL,
	"name" varchar NOT NULL,
	CONSTRAINT pk_cities PRIMARY KEY (id),
	CONSTRAINT fk_cities_province_id FOREIGN KEY (province_id) REFERENCES provinces(id)
);

CREATE TABLE districts (
	id int4 NOT NULL GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY,
	city_id int4 NOT NULL,
	"name" varchar NOT NULL,
	CONSTRAINT pk_districts PRIMARY KEY (id),
	CONSTRAINT fk_districts_city_id FOREIGN KEY (city_id) REFERENCES cities(id)
);

CREATE TABLE subdistricts (
	id int4 NOT NULL GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY,
	district_id int4 NOT NULL,
	"name" varchar NOT NULL,
	"code" varchar NOT NULL, -- subdistrict's administrative code
	postal_code varchar NOT NULL,
	CONSTRAINT pk_subdistricts PRIMARY KEY (id),
	CONSTRAINT fk_subdistricts_district_id FOREIGN KEY (district_id) REFERENCES districts(id)
);
```
